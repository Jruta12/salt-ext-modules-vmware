## Security

## Contributing

The [Salt Contributing guide][salt-contributing] has a lot of relevant information, but if you'd like to jump right in here's how to get started:

    # Clone the repo
    git clone --origin salt git@github.com:saltstack/salt-ext-modules-vmware.git

    # Change to the repo dir
    cd salt-ext-modules-vmware

    # Create a new venv
    python3 -m venv env --prompt vmw-ext
    source env/bin/activate

    # Install extension + test/dev/doc dependencies into your environment
    python -m pip install -e .[tests,dev,docs]

    # Run tests!
    python -m nox -e tests-3

    # skip requirements install for next time
    export SKIP_REQUIREMENTS_INSTALL=1

    # Build the docs, serve, and view in your web browser:
    python -m nox -e docs && (cd docs/_build/html; python -m webbrowser localhost:8000; python -m http.server; cd -)


Of course, writing code isn't the only way to contribute! We value
contributions in any of these areas:

- Documentation - especially examples of how to use this module to solve
  specific problems.
- Triaging [issues][issues] and participating in [discussions][discussions]
- Reviewing [Pull Requests][PRs] (we really like [Conventional
  Comments][comments]!)

You could also contribute in other ways:

- Writing blog posts
- Posting on social media about how you used Salt+VMware to solve your
  problems, including videos
- Giving talks at conferences
- Publishing videos
- Asking/answering questions in IRC, Slack, or email groups

Any of these things are super valuable to our community, and we sincerely
appreciate every contribution!


For more information, build the docs and head over to http://localhost:8000/ â€”
that's where you'll find the rest of the documentation.
